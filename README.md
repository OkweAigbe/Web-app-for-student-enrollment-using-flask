Proposal to my module lecturer, Dr Hisham Al-Assam. This is part of my course work on Web Development application SUFWAD620T2.
Spring 2020 Web Application Development.
Project Tittle: Student Enrolment Website.
•	A data- driven dynamic web application using Python web development framework called Flask.
•	Jinga 2 template engine will be used to create templates.
•	Mongo Db, a NoSQL database system will be used to stored data.
•	RESTful API will be used to perform CRUD operation.
The website will allow students to sign in with their registered ID.
After signing in, the user will have access to the Course offering on the web application and this will contain the following from headings:
Course ID, Title, Description of Couse, Credits of Course, Term and Enroll button for student to self- register.
A POST request will be sent to the DB to save information for registered students for any of the course.
Time permitting, I will implement a GET request on the Web Application.

Please see requirement.txt file for list of dependancies.
